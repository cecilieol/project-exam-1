## Description
We were tasked with creating a blog site, and I chose to create a blog for vegetarian and vegan recipes. I created an API through Wordpress to store all my recipes, and fetched them as a list and their single IDs for the details page. The site has an image carousel, a loading button for the recipe list, and the contact page has functional validation. Recipe images has a modal function for bigger view, and I have created the base for a comment system that is yet to go live.

## Built with
